# Movie List App

This is a project developed using the ReactJS library. It allows the user to search for any movie by title and to get information about it, as well as to optionally add it to a personal list of movies.

The movies information is obtained by API calls to the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

It also makes use of a Serverless Function for secure API Key handling (functions folder).

## Configuration

If you want to perform your own deployment, you will need to define the following build environment variable:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY = "your OMDb API key"
```

To get an OMDb API key, visit [here](https://omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
